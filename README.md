👋 Hey there, I'm James!

I'm a passionate developer, and I'm thrilled to introduce you to the Creativ Foundation! 🚀
🌟 About the Creativ Foundation

The Creativ Foundation was born from a simple idea: coding should be a tool for creativity and change, not just a technical skill. As someone who's been in the coding world for years, I’ve seen how traditional approaches can limit people's potential, and I believe it’s time to transform how people learn, teach, and think about code.
💡 Our Mission

At Creativ, we're on a mission to reshape the coding industry by teaching coding in a way that’s innovative, inclusive, and empowering. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, Creativ offers a fresh perspective to spark your creativity and unlock new ways of thinking. Through our programs, we aim to:

    Introduce a modern approach to coding education — where the emphasis isn’t just on syntax but on real-world impact and creativity.
    Break down barriers that keep people from feeling confident and creative in their coding journey.
    Build a vibrant community where coders of all skill levels can share ideas, collaborate, and learn from each other.

📅 Regular Lessons & Workshops

Our foundation hosts regular lessons and workshops designed to change the industry from the ground up. Our approach combines hands-on practice with a focus on big-picture thinking. We’re here to inspire the next generation of coders to:

    Think creatively about solving problems through code.
    Explore coding as a collaborative art where ideas and people come together to make a difference.
    Challenge traditional coding norms, empowering developers to forge their unique paths.
